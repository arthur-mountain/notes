# Abstract syntax tree(AST)

The AST usually use in the compiler.

It is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language.

Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code.

The syntax is "abstract" in not representing every detail appearing in the real syntax.
